## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

- We will communicate via Discord and Instagram for anything related to the project

- We will let each other know if we will miss a deadline
  - We will let each other know how much extra time we will require
    - It has to be a reasonable time period (e.g. not an extra 2 weeks)

- We will ask for help/guidance when required

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
- Discuss conflicts where possibke to synthesize ideas; if this is not possible or conflict continues, we go to majority vote
- Or if an idea is not feasible within the time frame, we will proceed with the other idea

## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
- if a team member notices any issues, they will bring it up to the group and explain their point of view
- the team member will then provide some ideas on how we can resolve this issue
- if the issue persists it will be noted in the peer feedback form and consult a TA or course instructor for some ideas on how we could go around the issue
- if the issue is not able to be resolved after all the prior steps . . .

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
- Completing their task within the mock due date set
- Updating team members on any delays or issues that arise when completing their part
