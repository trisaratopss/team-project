# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)

We will communicate via Discord and Instagram.

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time? 

We agree to respond to message within 24 hours, however if conflicts are known ahead of time we will let each other know for approximately how long we will be offline for.

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)

- Missing a deadline; letting us know how much extra time is required
- Absence for any specific reason (lectures and tutorials)
- Asking for help/guidance instead of struggling on our own
- 

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.

---

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
